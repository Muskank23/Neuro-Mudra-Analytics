Neuro Mudra Analytics is a research initiative led by Prof. Rajesh M. Hegde at IIT Kanpur, focusing on the classification of Yogic Mudras using EEG and EMG biosignals recorded from participants. The project involved collecting a novel dataset from 4 individuals performing 10 distinct meditation mudras, capturing both brain and muscle activity. From each EEG and EMG channel, over ten features were extracted—spanning statistical metrics and frequency bands (delta to gamma)—to effectively represent cognitive and muscular responses. A range of machine learning models, including LSTM, SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Trees, were applied for mudra classification. To address inter-subject variability, Domain-Adversarial Neural Networks (DANN) were employed, helping reduce domain shift and enhance cross-user generalization. The DANN approach achieved an overall accuracy of 81.82%, while traditional models like Random Forest and Decision Tree achieved up to 95% and 92% accuracy, respectively. This study highlights the promising intersection of yoga, neuroscience, and machine learning, paving the way for advancements in neuro-yogic analytics.
